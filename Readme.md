JMonitaur
================================

JMonitaur is a showcase template/example of a Java/JavaScript application with the following principles:
* Pure Java/JavaScript
* Separation of Java and JavaScript roles
* Component architecture testable at all levels

Technology Drivers and Choices
* Component architecture (prefer multi-Maven project over Ant)
* Testable templating language (prefer Freemarker over JSP)
* Simple and powerful layout control (prefer Sitemesh over all others)
* Maximised leverage of libraries (e.g. Spring, Jackson)
* Separation of web-development and JEE development (prefer all stand-alone JavaScript libraries tightly coupled client-server solutions)
* Allow choice between Single Page Interface (SPI) and multi-page
* Allow file-system DOM-JavaScript development and testing on multi-page applications
